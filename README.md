#This is my final project, it is a very simple movie review website

This site allows the users to:
-Sign up and log in
-Browse the movies and see details
-Submit and see reviews with star ratings
-See top rated movies (The only one should be The Matrix right now because I wrote some test reviews.)
-Search movies by title, genre, or year
-Filter the movies by genre and year

#Access
The address from my EC2 which the site is being hosted on is http://3.148.217.35

#Things I used to build the site
-Python and flask
-MySQL (Amazon RDS)
-AWS EC2 for hosting
-GitHub
